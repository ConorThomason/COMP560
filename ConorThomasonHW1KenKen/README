All code produced was tested and run through the latest version of OpenJDK
as of 9/27/2019. (Java 11). While I see no reason why earlier versions
of Java (to at least before Java 8) would not work, if any issues occur,
this would be a good place to start. Please ensure OpenJDK or OracleJDK are used.

The development of the assignment took place on Ubuntu 19.04 - Disco Dingo,
through IntelliJ Idea Ultimate. Ideally rebuilding the project won't
be necessary, but if it should become so, please let me know and I will be
sure to take appropriate action.

Steps to run:
As I recall you use a mac, ideally a bash terminal is available to you.
Ensure that the jar file provided (Main.jar) as well as the data file of
your choosing reside in the same directory. Please ensure the file is named
"Data". No extension was used in the development of this assignment,
so if any issues are encountered, please remove the extension.
In a command line that makes use of java, enter the command as follows:

java -jar Main.jar

This should run the program in the command line, producing the output as requested.
It is worth nothing that the local search is, admittedly, inefficient.
The upper limit is 100 seconds, and I have verified that it is capable
of producing a correct solution, and I have theorised why it is so slow
in the submitted PDF report; if you feel the need to cancel the operation
of the program, CTRL+C/CTRL+D should end execution sufficiently.
